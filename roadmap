ROADMAP
=======

The goal of the openlinux project is to build a complete, clean, and stable userspace from scratch, with a 
strong focus on portability and POSIX compliance. Below are the main development stages and planned features.


Short-term Goals
----------------

 - Complete header implementation – ensure a complete and correct set of system headers.
 - Complete header tests (compile-time) – verify the correctness of headers during compilation.
 - Add missing functions in libc – expand the functionality of the standard library.
 - Split the built rootfs into packages – modularize the system for easier distribution and updates.
 - Add documentation in headers – enable better integration with tools like LSP and Clangd, providing accurate and convenient developer hints.

Mid-term Goals
--------------

 - Init system
 - Complete the shell – create a fully POSIX-compliant command interpreter.
 - Add POSIX coreutils – implement essential POSIX-compliant system utilities.
 - LLVM utilities - clang llvm-nm....
 - Linux utilities – extend user-facing system tools to increase environment functionality.

Long-term Goals
---------------
 - Write a bootloader for x86_64/aarch64 – a lightweight bootloader that starts the kernel and mounts partitions, minimizing the need for an initramfs.
 - Add QEMU emulation – currently only Docker is available for rootfs development; full virtual machine emulation support is planned.
 - Add developer documentation – create comprehensive guides and examples for software developers.
