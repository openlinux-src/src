openlinux
=========

A  lightweight  Linux  distribution  for  x86_64  and   aarch64   processor
architectures.

Philosophy
----------

The core philosophy behind openlinux is to  redefine  the  role  of  the  C
standard library (libc) as a lightweight, stable,  and  portable  interface
between user code and the kernel — not as a  duplication  of  the  kernel’s
headers and definitions.

In many existing implementations, the libc layer attempts to  replicate  or
shadow kernel interfaces, leading to inconsistencies, ABI  divergence,  and
maintenance  challenges  across  UNIX-like  systems.   In   openlinux,   we
intentionally avoid such redundancy. The system  headers  provided  by  the
kernel  should  remain  the  single  source  of  truth   for   kernel-level
programming. The libc’s role is to bridge, not to emulate, the kernel.

For  this  reason,  openlinux/libc  does  not  provide   redundant   kernel
definitions, nor does it attempt to mimic every aspect of the kernel’s API.
Similarly, the library  does  not  yet  implement  full  locale  support  —
although the necessary symbols and user-space API definitions are in  place
to ensure compatibility with existing software. A future companion  library
is planned to allow developers to override  standard  libc  functions  with
complete locale-aware  implementations,  without  relying  on  weak  symbol
bindings.

Our design goals  are  portability,  clarity,  and  stability.  Instead  of
assembling prebuilt components like modern Linux distributions often do, we
are building a complete userspace stack from  scratch,  taking  inspiration
from the best design choices of established systems such as BSD, musl,  and
Bionic.

The project was born from the lack of  a  BSD-style,  monorepo-based  Linux
environment — one that provides consistent ABI, predictable rollouts, and a
truly cohesive userspace. We aim for gradual, deliberate development rather
than rushed releases. See the ROADMAP file for details on current  progress
and planned milestones.

Special Thanks

This project draws  inspiration  from  the  following  excellent  projects:
Google Bionic libc, musl  libc,  GNU  glibc,  uClibc-ng,  NetBSD,  OpenBSD,
Newlib, Linux, picolibc, Embedded  Artistry  libc,  Clang  and  GCC  source
codes.
